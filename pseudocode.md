wondering if grid would be a good idea for this 
do I use cards in side the grid or just cards?


search title
search bar
    ajax and .then?
    append the searches to a list 
    save in local storage
    the last city you searched will be loaded on start


when the search button is clicked 
    the city name appears below in search history
        you can click on any saved searches an view that city
    the weather forecast appears to the right (Full weather card -top)
        City / Date / Icon for weather
        Temperature
        Humidity
        Wind Speed
        UV Index (with a background based on intervals) - use badge
    the 5-day forcast appears to the right (5day - bottom
        5 cards with:
            date
